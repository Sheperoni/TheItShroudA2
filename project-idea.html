<h1>Our Project Idea</h1>
<p>Early on in the project idea development process, Matt and Jackson talked amongst the group and themselves about how their project ideas were quite similar and how Jackson's idea would fit right in with Matthew's project. To summarise their projects, Jackson worked on developing a Raspberry Pi device that would allow users to discover the amount of water that their water tank holds and Matt worked on an app and device that also utilises the Raspberry Pi connectivity that allows users to open and close garage doors and turning on lights all through an android developed application. Together as a group, everybody helped to discover the potential of a simpler smart home which includes Jackson's idea (water tank sensor) and Matthew's idea (opening garage door and operation lights using an android phone application) in combination with each other.</p>

<h2>Simpler Smart Home</h2>
    <p>The IT Shroud’s project idea is to combine two members Assessment One projects, into a home information and automation app. This project pairs M. Andrew’s raspberry pi Bluetooth/web activated garage door and lighting, with J. Shepard’s raspberry pi wireless water tank level meter. The idea is to utilise the Raspberry Pi’s on-board internet and Bluetooth connectivity to pair with a simple, specially made Android phone app, which will allow you to open and close your home garage door and adjust selected Bluetooth enabled interior lighting- from anywhere, as well as displaying your homes water tank level.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The project is based on the idea of a Smart Home but will be quite simple. Smart lighting is the ability to control lighting in your home with a smart phone or tablet. Smart lighting has been created before, with companies such as IKEA, Apple, LifX to name a few, all providing Wi-Fi connected phone apps for Android and iPhone to control lighting. Some smart lighting apps also allow you to change the hue and saturation of colour that lights produce, but this requires special bulbs. Some companies give their apps an ‘away from home’ feature; so you’re able to control lighting no matter where you are. This is handy if you accidentally leave the lights on, or want the lights to be on for when you get home from work at night.</p>

    <p>The wireless water tank level meter will be able to determine the level of any type of rainwater tank, so the homeowners know how much rain water they have in their tank. This will also include a basic and easy to understand GUI that allows anyone to be able to use this product and to understand what the different levels mean. It will also include some form of notification when the levels of the tank get low, which can be done through either an app notification, email or other types of software. This information will be very useful especially to rural land owners or urban home owners who only have access to rain tank water.</p>  
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Pi is simple and easy to use and is a great tool to learn programming with (for example, Python or Scratch). For this project the Raspberry Pi will be connected via Bluetooth to your garage door and its simple task is to open and close the circuit remotely so the door will raise or lower. The Pi can also be connected to specific lighting in your home via Bluetooth, which will be controlled from the app too. The Raspberry Pi’s will be connected to the app via a network over WIFI. This app will be useful to those people who want a cheaper, centralised remote to control some basic functions in their home. The garage door and lighting can be accessible as a group or individually in the app. A timer feature can be utilised, which will also allow users to set times for when they wish the lamps to be turned on or switched off. As we are using a WIFI connection, the only power needed will be the Raspberry Pi which powers the entire system, so running and hiding cable won’t be too difficult as there is only one cable coming into and leaving the mounting box. Managing this software will be done through a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) method which can connect straight to the Raspberry Pi and display the correct levels and the tank percentage as well as a diagram that is done through writing a little bit of code. The overall design and the way in which is mounted is completely up to the user but it is best to have all cables hidden and to have the container with all the components in an easy to access spot incase things do not work or the Raspberry Pi turns off, which can be easily turned back on with the push of a button</p>
